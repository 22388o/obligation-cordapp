     * Task 1.
     * We already have a flow that generates a partially signed transaction, now we need to build a flow that given
     * a [SignedTransaction] returns a [DigitalSignature] over that transaction. Instead of implementing this
     * functionality within the [IOUIssueFlow] we will use a generic set of two flows called [CollectSignatureFlow]
     * which can be used with multiple types of transaction, e.g. transferring and settling IOUs.
     * This [CollectSignatureFlow] can be called as a [subFlow] from the [IOUIssueFlow].
     * TODO: Implement the [IOUIssueFlow.Responder] flow which should return a [DigitalSignature.WithKey]
     * Hint:
     * - [CollectSignatureFlow.Initiator] is already implemented. It only has one statement which is a call of the
     *   [sendAndReceive] method which sends a [SignedTransaction] to the [otherParty] and waits for them to return a
     *   [DigitalSignature.WithKey].
     * - Implementing the responder requires a you to write a few lines of code...
     * - Most importantly, you'll need to [receive] the [SignedTransaction] from the [otherParty]. This method can be
     *   found here [FlowLogic.receive]
     * - Next, you'll need to [verify] the [SignedTransaction] and check the [otherParty]'s signature is valid.
     * - To [verify] a [SignedTransaction], you need to convert its [SignedTransaction.tx] property to a
     *   [LedgerTransaction].
     * - To check signatures use the [SignedTransaction.verifySignatures] method. You'll need to add the [CompositeKeys]
     *   for the signatures you DO NOT want to check, in this case, the party running the
     *   [CollectSignatureFlow.Responder] flow and the notary.
     * - Once you are satisfied the transaction is valid then you need to sign it with your [KeyPair] using the
     *   [SignedTransaction.signWithECDSA] method which returns a [DigitalSignature.WithKey].
     * - [send] the [DigitalSignature.WithKey] back to the [otherParty].

# Corda Training Solutions

This is a temporary repo for Roger to build out the latest iteration of the Corda training.

Work done:

* Rebased to M10
* Added CollectSignatureFlow
* Added extensive helper comments in all unit test files
* Improved unit tests

Todo:

* Add Settle contract code, flow and API endpoints
* Update web app to allow transfer and settlement of IOUs
* Create the template repo to be used for training
* Split out the solutions into stages based on each incremental unit test
* Port the CollectSignatureFlow into the main Corda repo (requires changes!)

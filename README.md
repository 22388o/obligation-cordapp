# The Obligation CorDapp

This is an example of how to develop a CorDapp. It implements a simple obligation state that represents a debt from one party to another. 

THe CorDapp allows you to issue, transfer (from old lender to new lender) and settle (with cash) obligations. It also comes with an API and website that allows you to do all of the aformentioned things.

Obligations are issued, tranferred and settled using the confidential identities features of Corda.
